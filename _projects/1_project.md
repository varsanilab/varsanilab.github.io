As apex predators, felid species play an important role in the ecosystem. Many felid species are in decline as a result of several factors, including disease.
We work with veterinarians and wildlife managers to characterize novel and known viruses, elucidate cross-species viral transmission events, origins and evolutionary
dynamics in order to understand the viruses that infect some of these elusive big cat species such as Puma, Bobcats, Caracals, and Canada lynx.
