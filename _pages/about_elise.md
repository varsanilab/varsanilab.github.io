I am a PhD candidate at Duke University using metagenomic and One Health approaches to study viral diversity in
endemic, invasive, and domestic animals and people. My work focuses on both the captive setting – lemurs and staff at the Duke Lemur Center – and on anthropogenic landscapes – lemurs, rodents, domestic animals, and people in southeastern Madagascar. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Notre Dame in 2020 while working with the Amboseli Baboon Research Project.
