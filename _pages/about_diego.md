I am a local Arizonan born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. I obtained my undergraduate degrees from Northern Arizona University in chemistry and biology in 2020. I started my Ph.D. program in the fall of 2021 and am now in my third year at ASU.

My research focuses on the viral ecology and evolution of DNA viruses associated with American waterfowl species, which has given me a new hobby: bird-watching while collecting fecal samples. Outside of my research, I love bouldering, exercising, camping, and cooking in my free time.
