Iâ€™m a Ph.D student studying how insects respond to complex environmental stressors. I completed my undergraduate degree in Sustainability in 2022 and now work in the [Global Locust Initiative lab](https://globalfutures.asu.edu/global-locust-initiative/) studying how population density affects viral communities and immune function of lab and field insect populations. Outside the lab you can find me hiking and looking for wildlife across Arizona.
