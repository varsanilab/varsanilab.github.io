I obtained a doctoral degree in Natural Resources with an emphasis in Wildlife Conservation at the University of Arizona in 2022
<<<<<<< HEAD
My doctoral dissertation focused on the application of genomic approaches to the conservation of Sonoran wildlife. I am an NSF-Postdoctoral Fellow in the Varsani Lab working in collaboration with the Baja Geogenomics Consortium and the University of Arizona Conservation Genetics Lab. My current research focuses on host-virus dynamics and viral diversity associated with wild populations of vertebrate species across the Baja California peninsula and the Sonoran Desert in Arizona.
