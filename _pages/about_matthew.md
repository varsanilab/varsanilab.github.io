n and raised in the Phoenix, AZ area through high school, I moved back home after graduating from Occidental College (Los Angeles, CA, USA) in 2023. There, I obtained my degree in biochemistry with a minor in public health. My undergraduate research experiences – in immunology and public health – inspired me to further pursue a career in science. Following graduation, I began my position in the Varsani lab at Arizona State University.

My research focus has since transformed to encompass the ecology and evolution of various wildlife viruses. Looking forward, I plan to pursue graduate programs that emphasize both molecular and bioinformatic methods, with consideration to the “One Health” global health framework. Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking, hiking, traveling, and shooting film photography.
