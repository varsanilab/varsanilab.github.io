I am a nomadic `viral` virologist, born and raised in Kenya. I have lived, studied, and worked in England 4 years, South Africa 11 years, New Zealand 8 years. I am currently based in the US in the Sonoran desert.

I strongly advocate `UBUNTU`, an African philosophy focusing on peopleâ€™s allegiances and relationships, including those of the local community. I strongly believe that it is extremely important to engage the local community, especially in research involving native fauna and flora, which often has major cultural significance to indigenous peoples.
