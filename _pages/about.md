`A data-centric molecular virology research group that studies viral dynamics across ecosystems`
`Our broader objectives are to:`
`1)` Study viral dynamics in Ross Sea (Antarctica) ecosystem which is recognised as anthropogenically the least-altered marine system on the planet with no evidence indicating introduction or range expansion of any species thus far, despite its changing physical environment
`2)`Unravel the viral evolutionary dynamics as a consequence of climate change
`3)`Study viral ecological interaction networks within a microbiome to unravel the dynamics of pathogen emergence
