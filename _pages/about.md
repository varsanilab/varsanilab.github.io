A data-centric molecular virology research group that studies viral dynamics across ecosystems.

Our broader objectives are to:

1. **Study viral dynamics in Ross Sea (Antarctica) ecosystem**, which is recognized as anthropogenically the least-altered marine system on the planet with no evidence indicating introduction or range expansion of any species thus far, despite its changing physical environment.

2. **Unravel the viral evolutionary dynamics as a consequence of climate change.**

3. **Study viral ecological interaction networks within a microbiome** to unravel the dynamics of pathogen emergence.
