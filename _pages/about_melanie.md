Originally from Mexico and raised in different countries, I consider myself to be a global wanderer. I am a graduate student studying Molecular and Cellular Biology. My primary research is focused on viruses infecting animal populations from Antarctica.

I am interested in how these viral entities affect these isolated ecosystems. After obtaining my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology Engineering, my passion for science increased. Besides spending time in the lab I enjoy doing outdoor activities under the sun, painting, crocheting, and dancing.
