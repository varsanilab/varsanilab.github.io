I am a Ph.D candidate studying Microbiology at ASU. My primary research interests focus on the origins of human and animal collapse that (potentially) cause disease in hosts.

My research project focuses on viruses associated with bees and a few other pollinating insects. In my spare time I like to take bike rides, exercise, fish, and try new restaurants.
