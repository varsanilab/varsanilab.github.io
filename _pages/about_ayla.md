I am a PhD student studying molecular and cellular biology here at ASU. My primary research interests are rooted in the viruses that infect carnivores, and the variations in viral communities between species. When I am not in the lab (or when I am not traveling somewhere), I am likely doing something active, reading, crocheting, or spending some time under the sun
